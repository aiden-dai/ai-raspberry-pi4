# Install Tensorflow Lite

Install Tensorflow Lite interpreter

> This interpreter-only package is a fraction the size of the full TensorFlow package and includes the bare minimum code required to run inferences with TensorFlow Liteâ€”it includes only the tf.lite.Interpreter Python class. This small package is ideal when all you want to do is execute .tflite models and avoid wasting disk space with the large TensorFlow library.
